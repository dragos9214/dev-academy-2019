# Branch timeline
## Development 01

This branch contains the code of a maven basic "Hello World" application. This is the starting point of our movie store application.

### How did we get here: 
  * We cloned the github repository [here](https://github.com/dragos9214/dev-academy-2019.git)
  * We checked out **development-01** branch.
  * The project was initially generated using the Spring initializr [website](https://start.spring.io/)
 
### Check if it works for you:
  * Go to Application.java class and hit **CTRL + SHIFT + F10**
    * You should get the ***Hello World*** message in the console output.
    
### Files created in this branch:
  * .gitignore ~ specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. Files already tracked by Git are not affected. Find out more [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).
  * pom.xml ~ A Project Object Model or POM is the fundamental unit of work in Maven. It is an XML file that contains information about the project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project. It contains default values for most projects. Examples for this is the build directory, which is target; the source directory, which is src/main/java; the test source directory, which is src/test/java; and so on. Find out more [here](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html).
