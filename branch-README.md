# Branch timeline
## Development 01

This branch contains the code of a maven basic "Hello World" application. This is the starting point of our movie store application.

### How did we get here: 
  * We cloned the github repository [here](https://github.com/dragos9214/dev-academy-2019.git)
  * We checked out **development-01** branch.
  * The project was initially generated using the Spring initializr [website](https://start.spring.io/)
 
### Check if it works for you:
  * Go to Application.java class and hit **CTRL + SHIFT + F10**
    * You should get the ***Hello World*** message in the console output.
    
### Files created in this branch:
  * .gitignore ~ specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. Files already tracked by Git are not affected. Find out more [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).
  * pom.xml ~ A Project Object Model or POM is the fundamental unit of work in Maven. It is an XML file that contains information about the project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project. It contains default values for most projects. Examples for this is the build directory, which is target; the source directory, which is src/main/java; the test source directory, which is src/test/java; and so on. Find out more [here](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html).

## Development 02

This branch contains a basic MVC + Service movie application. The Controller exposes a get all movies method that is then used by the view element in order for the movies to be displayed.
The service represents the component of the application responsible with the business logic related to Movie model.
 
### How did we get here:
  * We created the controller class that requires a service to retrieve the movies from.
  * We created the service and some dummy movies.
  * We added a view that consumes the controller info.
  * We bind all the components in the Application class.
 
### Check if it works for you:
   * Go to Application.java class and hit **CTRL + SHIFT + F10**
     * You should get the ***User Movies*** list in the console output.

### Files created in this branch:
  * MovieController.java ~ Movie Controller class
  * MovieService.java ~ Movie Service class - Business Logic that retrieves or manages the movie entities
  * View.java ~ Simple view that outputs to console the movies

## Development 03

This branch describes how Spring is added to a maven project and how Spring Dependency injection is used. The principle behind Spring Events is also described.

### How did we get here:
  * We added the Spring web dependency in our [pom.xml](./pom.xml) file
  * We removed all code in the [Application main function](./src/main/java/com/orange/moviestore/Application.java) app and added the Spring boot app annotation and run.
  * We annotated all service classes with *@Service*
  * We added the *ApplicationStartedEvent* listener to the [View Class](./src/main/java/com/orange/moviestore/View.java)
    
### Check if it works for you:
  * Go to Application.java class and hit **CTRL + SHIFT + F10**
       * You should get the Spring Boot logo and specific Spring logs in the console output.
       * You should get the ***User Movies*** list in the end of the console output.
### Files created in this branch:
***NONE***

## Development 04

This branch describes how a REST controller is created using Spring.

### How did we get here:
  * We removed the View.java file as we no longer need to print the movies in the console, we're moving to WEB
  * We changed the movie controller from *@Service* to *@RestController*
  * We annotate the get method of the movie controller with the *@GetMapping*
  * We configured the port we want the server to work on: 8090
  
### Check if it works for you:
  * Go to Application.java class and hit **CTRL + SHIFT + F10**
    * You should get the Spring Boot logo and specific Spring logs in the console output.
    * You should see the ***"Started Application in ... seconds"*** log.
  * Open your favorite browser and access http://localhost:8090/movie
    * You should see the movies in JSON format.
    
### Files created in this branch:
  * [application.properties](./src/main/resources/application.properties) ~ The Spring application configuration file
  
## Development 05

This branch describes how we can connect to a MongoDB from a Spring application.

### How did we get here:
  * We added Spring Data dependency for MongoDB in our  [pom.xml](./pom.xml) file
  * We added a new field to Movie model and mark it as id with @Id annotation.
  * We created a repository interface who will provide basic operations for our database.
  * We removed the dummy data from the movie service and called the movie repository to provide data from our DB.
  * We added spring.data.mongodb properties in [application.properties](./src/main/resources/application.properties) file.
  * We implemented CommandLineRunner interface in Application class and overrode run method to insert some dummy data to our DB after the startup.
  
 ### Check if it works for you:
  * Go to Application.java class and hit **CTRL + SHIFT + F10**
  * Open your favorite browser and access http://localhost:8090/movie
    * You should see the movies in JSON format.
    
 ### Files created in this branch:
  * MoviesRepository.java ~ Movies Repository class - Provide CRUD operations to the database. 
  
## Development 06

In this branch we show what data model structure we need for the business objects and for our DTOs

### How did we get here:
  * Created DTO files with the help of http://www.jsonschema2pojo.org/
  * Modified and added some fields to the Movie class
  * Removed the CommandLineRunner from our application
  * Created the OMDBClient interface, describing what we would like our client do do
  * Added a static list of movies in application.yml

### Check if it works for you:
  * Run the application by hitting **SHIFT + F10**
  * Open a browser and access http://localhost:8090/movie
    * You should see an empty list []
    
## Development 07

In this branch we show how easy it is to make REST calls with feign

### How did we get here:
  * Added the required annotations to OMDBClient and Application
  * Added extra business objects to represent the data we want our API to offer
  * Added dependency management to the POM

### Check if it works for you:
  * Run the application by hitting **SHIFT + F10**
  * Open a browser and access http://localhost:8090/movie
    * You should see an empty list []
    
## Development 08

In this branch we map raw data from the client to usable data for our API

### How did we get here:
  * Created a service that can use the omdb client to provide all the media content we need
  * Read properties from application.yml using a configuration class

### Check if it works for you:
  * Run the application by hitting **SHIFT + F10**
  * Open a browser and access http://localhost:8090/movie
    * You should see an empty list []
    
## Development 09

In this branch we schedule a task that refreshes the data in our MongoDb

### How did we get here:
  * Created a service that refreshes the database at a fixed interval

### Check if it works for you:
  * Run the application by hitting **SHIFT + F10**
  * You should see refresh messages in the logs, indicating that the scheduled task is working
  
## Development 10

In this branch we tie it all together by modifying our original endpoint to retrieve data from our database

### How did we get here:
  * Added another query method for our DB connector, providing the ability to search by title
  * Added another method to the service that uses the DB connector, using the method defined at the previous step
  * Added a "retrieve all" and a "search by title" option to our main controller

### Check if it works for you:
  * Run the application by hitting **SHIFT + F10**
  * Open a browser and access http://localhost:8090/movie
    * You should see a list with all our movies and shows
    * Adding the "?title=_something_" paramete should filter the results
